error: Field 'count' has conflicting attributes: skip_setter and setter_name.

       The skip_setter attribute prevents setter method generation, but the presence of setter_name indicates you still want to have a setter. We can't resolve this ambiguity automatically, so you need to fix the issue.

       Either:
       1. Remove setter_name = "custom_name" to keep skip_setter
       2. Remove skip_setter to generate a setter with the custom name

       Example fixes:
         // Option 1: Field with no setter (auto-generated value)
         #[builder(default = "...", skip_setter)]
         count: u32,

         // Option 2: Field with custom setter name
         #[builder(setter_name = "custom_name")]
         count: u32,
