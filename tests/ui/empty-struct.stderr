error: Struct 'EmptyStruct' has no fields.

       Builder generation requires at least one field to be meaningful.

       Add some fields to your struct:
         struct EmptyStruct {
           // Add fields here
           field_name: FieldType,
         }

  = note: this error originates in the derive macro `TypeStateBuilder` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
